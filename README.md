all allowed and then choose from a list of recordings with the information about creator and
tag. Each recording is colored with the following meaning: 

![#008609](https://via.placeholder.com/15/008609/008609.png) recording is in scope  
![#a7e006](https://via.placeholder.com/15/a7e006/a7e006.png) recording is from a friend but not in scope  
![#d39104](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d39104/d39104.png) a user who is not your friend recorded this  
![#0930b0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0930b0/0930b0.png) you recorded this yourself  
![#b43535](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b43535/b43535.png) not available, record the word!  
![#881111](https://via.placeholder.com/15/881111/881111.png) invalid, only letters are allowed

## Friends and scope
On your Userpage (upper right corner) there is a friends section. You can connect with other
users here by sending them a friendship request. After they accept it in the same place your
friends recordings will automatically be preferred and you can use their recordings with
accessibility 'FRIENDS'. 

On top of the main page you can choose a selection of your friends as your scope to prefer
their recordings this time.

## Recording
Record a word and add it to the database. You must fill in the following metadata for each
record:  

**word** which word did you record  
**tag** add a fitting tag like 'normal', 'accent' or 'funny'  
**accessibility** decide if everyone, only your friends or only yourself can use this recording in their messages

There are different ways to get to the record page: 
- Click on the record symbol in the upper left corner; you can simply record a few words here and navigate to another place afterwards.
- After submitting a text open one of the word select menus and click on record. You are navigated to a special record page where you can record this single word and back to the main page with your previously entered text.
- After submitting a text click on the 'record missing words' or 'record all words' button. Just like in the case before you are navigated to the special record page and can record all the words you need comfortably in a row

You can hear again, edit and delete your recordings on the user page. 

## History
Also on your user page there is a 'History' page. Here you can see your last requested audios
and by clicking on a history element you are navigated to the main page with the exact same text
and recordings selected like the last time you requested this.
